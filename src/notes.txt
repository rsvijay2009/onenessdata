Need to create a column percentage in top and bottom 5


Create two drop down to shows the columns and create a another one to choose the relationship for join(Select multiple columns)


After join redirect to another page and show the result

Save the table only if the user like to save(Display it in the left panel under join option)


Sum operation

dipalsy all the selected columns in select column drop down and unique key


select product, sum(price) as sum_price, from php_sales group by (product);


Remove the group by drop down do it manually in the background

column name - user_key value (concat of selected column values (ex video_game, 55 = video_games_55))


We need to save the prepare result in a new table along with the origional table name once user wish to save the data



Compare error for same two table relationship


Alter the stored procedure

assign variables to get all the compare data

select DISTINCT(product) from php_sales UNION select DISTINCT(product) from php_sales; - reference






slect all option for all drop down

new project under reconcile - Done

join - save table

reconcile - save table - display data


Rename tables
----------------
option to select project and then table name 

option to delete join and reconcile tables


If we show the table name without concat project name_ then user will confuse if they have same table name for two differet projects

and also we need to show duplicate table names in drop down as well
