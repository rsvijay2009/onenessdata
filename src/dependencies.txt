Cannot use phpoffice/phpspreadsheet's latest version 2.1.0 as it requires ext-gd * which is missing from your platform.


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-gd


Enable gd library in php.ini file and restart the apache server

composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet --platform="php": "8.0"
